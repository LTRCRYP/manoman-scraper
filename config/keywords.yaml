# Keywords used to filter jobs (case-insensitive match in title + description).
# Jobs are included only if they match at least one PRIMARY keyword (strong crypto/blockchain terms).
# Secondary keywords are NOT used for filtering — they were removed to cut non-crypto jobs
# (e.g. "token", "ledger", "wallet", "protocol" match many non-crypto roles).

# Primary: clearly crypto/blockchain — job must match at least one of these
keywords:
  - blockchain
  - cryptocurrency
  - crypto
  - web3

  - smart contract
  - solidity
  - ethereum
